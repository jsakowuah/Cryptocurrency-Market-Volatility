Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies: How Volatile is the Cryto Market? 
Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies or 'cryptos' in slang. Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future. By December of 2017, Bitcoin for example, had a market capitalization above $200 billion.  While the growth of bitcoin seems promising, one cannot overlook the high level of insecurity and volatility surrounding the crypto market in general. The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile and any money you put in might disappear into thin air.  Cryptocurrencies mentioned in this analysis might be good assets or scams. 

I explore the following questions to provide insights about the state of the cryptocurrency financial market. 

1. How big is bitcoin compared to other cryptos?
2. How volatile are cryptocurrencies?
3. How volatile are cryptos within a 24 - hour span? 
4. How volatile are cryptos within a 1 week period?

Worth noting is that, this analysis does not seem to promote cryptocurrency or any particular kind of crytpocurrency neither does it seem to discredit the crypto market. Rather, this analysis aims at providing you with business insights about the performance of cryptocurriencies so you can make a personal data - driven decisions about the acquisition of cryptos. The final judgement is hence subjective.
